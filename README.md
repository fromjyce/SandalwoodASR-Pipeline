## **Problem Statement**  
Sandalwood holds immense cultural, therapeutic, and economic significance in India, particularly in Karnataka. Despite its value, knowledge about its cultivation remains fragmented. The challenge was to create a robust workflow that processes Kannada-language audio resources, enabling laypersons to query these resources for relevant information.  

The tasks included:  
1. **Speech Recognition (ASR):** Develop a Kannada ASR model tailored to colloquial speech for converting audio into searchable text.  
2. **Speech-Based Question Answering:** Build a pipeline to process user queries (speech or text) and return relevant segments of audio and text-based answers.  

---

## **Dataset**  
The dataset consists of 71 Kannada-language audio files scraped from YouTube, focusing on sandalwood cultivation. These files were recorded in natural, colloquial language with minor background noise, making it a realistic and challenging corpus.  

---

## **Task 1: Speech Recognition Workflow**  
We developed an ASR pipeline using state-of-the-art open-source tools and models, optimized for the colloquial Kannada language.  

### **Workflow Architecture**  
**1. Speech Input:** Users upload or record their audio.  
**2. Denoising:** Audio is preprocessed with **Denoiser DNS 64** by META Research for noise reduction.  
**3. Voice Enhancement:** Audio clarity is enhanced using **Pyannote-audio-enhancer**.  
**4. Speech Segmentation:** Using **Pyannote Speech Segmentation**, the audio is segmented into manageable chunks, aiding transcription accuracy.  
**5. Kannada Transcription:** Transcription of Kannada speech is performed with models like **whisper-kannada-tiny**.  
**6. Punctuation and Transliteration:** Transcribed text undergoes punctuation restoration, transliteration, and translation to English using the **AI4Bharat** model.  
**7. Grammar and Spell Check:** The English text is refined for grammatical correctness and readability.

### **Outcome**  
The ASR model accurately transcribes and translates Kannada audio, producing grammatically refined English text ready for search and query processing.
